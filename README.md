A simple web app to help busy group find a home.

* **Connected:** LFHT brings collaboration to the home search (imagine a cross between Google Docs and Zillow)! Share properties and collaborating on living spaces with a roommate, spouse or friends and family. Gone are the days where listings are shared across several methods of communicaiton, making it hard to find the listing that you just shared... wait, where did it just go?! 
* **Stored History:** Since listings are tied to individual groups of two or more users, your groups will persist unless deleted. The benefit here is that you can easily find listings, rentals, homes that you had previously occupied. For those looking to use our app to rent, this will allow you to return to homes that you may want to try again! This is especially useful for personal travel outside of your town or state of residence!
* **Search Once, Find the Right Home:** Create a profile to begin saving homes, create your group, and leave the rest to us! üòâ
